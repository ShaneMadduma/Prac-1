                            Shane has had an interest in technology and gadgets for his entire life and
                            has pursued that interest through his education, teaching and research.
                            With an early desire to become a novelist when he commenced his
                            university journey, Shane transitioned into the field of information technology
                            but maintained that creative drive through games and digital narratives.
                            Having worked in industry for a time in general IT roles Brett returned to
                            university to pursue a research career. In the early 2000s, he developed a
                            web browser for the iPAQ PDA that tailored web content to the reduced
                            screen real estate and functionality afforded by those mobile devices. He
                            then continued his exploration of novel interaction domains by developing
                            and evaluating the use of indirect interaction techniques within an optical
                            see through augmented reality environment.
